clParse is a small (probably buggy, notably untested) web based PHP application that aggregates Craigslist RSS feeds onto one page. Listings can either be flagged or hidden from display. I use it to quickly flag the listings that I want to respond to throughout the day and later hide them after I respond. I also hide listings that are spam or do not fit my needs.

Feel free to download and play with it. It was not built for use on a public server, so donâ€™t come crying to me if your SQLs get injected.

Prerequisites:
Requires the MagpieRSS library, and expects it to be found at `MagpieRSS/` in the project root.

Release under the MIT licence.  Do whatever you want with it!

*INSTALLATION*

Throw the files onto a PHP/Apache server, and fill out your MySQL connection details in `settings.php`.  Then, fill up the `urls` in `settings.php` with a list of craigslist RSS feeds that you'd like to search.

Download a copy of MagpieRSS (http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) and put it in the project root.  You should be ready to go at that point.
