clParse is a small (probably buggy, notably untested) web based PHP application that aggregates Craigslist RSS feeds onto one page. Listings can either be flagged or hidden from display. I use it to quickly flag the listings that I want to respond to throughout the day and later hide them after I respond. I also hide listings that are spam or do not fit my needs.

Feel free to download and play with it. It was not built for use on a public server, so donâ€™t come crying to me if your SQLs get injected.

Prerequisites:
Requires the MagpieRSS library, and expects it to be found at /MagpieRSS in the project root.
